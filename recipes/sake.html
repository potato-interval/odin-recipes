    <p>Sake, often referred to as rice wine, is a traditional Japanese alcoholic beverage made from fermented rice. It's typically clear and can vary in taste from sweet to dry, and light to full-bodied, depending on the brewing process.</p>
    <h2>service practices</h2>
    <p>In traditional settings, it's common for sake to be served by someone else at the table as a sign of friendship or respect. It's typically poured into small porcelain cups called "ochoko".</p>
    <h2>interesting facts</h2>
    <p>Sake is brewed through a unique process called multiple parallel fermentation, where the starch is converted into sugars, and sugars are converted into alcohol simultaneously. It can be enjoyed warm, at room temperature, or chilled, depending on the type of sake and personal preference.</p>
