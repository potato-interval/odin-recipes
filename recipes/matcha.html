    <p>Matcha is a type of powdered green tea that's traditionally used in 
      Japanese tea ceremonies. It has a vibrant green color and a distinctive, 
      slightly bitter flavor.</p>
    <h2>service practices</h2>
    <p>Matcha is traditionally prepared in a tea bowl with a bamboo whisk. The 
      tea is served in a ceremonial manner, and the bowl is often passed 
      between guests.</p>
    <h2>interesting facts</h2>
    <p>Matcha is made from shade-grown tea leaves, which boosts their 
      chlorophyll content and gives matcha its bright green color. The tea 
      leaves are ground into a fine powder, which is whisked with hot water to 
      make matcha tea.</p>
